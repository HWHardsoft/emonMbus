# Arduino M-BUS Master node for Arduino MKR M-BUS Shield

This software will read out a M-BUS device connected to an Arduino MKR board equipped with our [Arduino MKR M-BUS shield](https://www.hwhardsoft.de/english/projects/m-bus-mkr-shield/).

## Data decoding
This example contains code to decode data of a energy meter. You have to change this section regarding your connected device. It is recommed to use the software [M-BUS repeater](https://github.com/HWHardsoft/Arduino-MBUS-repeater/), to analyse the received data more in detail.
